I am a Political Science Ph.D. Candidate at the University of British Columbia. My research focuses on political economy of development and political behavior, with a regional specialization in Latin America. For my dissertation, I study the formation and scope of populist mobilizations in two Andean countries: Peru and Bolivia. Using network analysis and GSI techniques, I analyse how populism can emerge from bottom-up processes in the developing world.
